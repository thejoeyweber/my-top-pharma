# SEC EDGAR Implementation Summary

This document provides a summary of the SEC EDGAR integration implementation, including the components created, how they work together, and instructions for verifying the implementation.

## Implementation Overview

We have implemented a comprehensive data pipeline for retrieving and processing pharmaceutical and biotech company data from the SEC EDGAR database. The implementation includes:

1. **SEC EDGAR API Client**: A Python module for interacting with the SEC EDGAR API with proper rate limiting
2. **Company Universe Flow**: A Prefect flow for retrieving all pharmaceutical companies by SIC codes
3. **Database Schema**: Tables for storing SEC company data, filings, and pipeline run logs
4. **Prefect Integration**: Deployment, scheduling, and agent configuration
5. **MinIO S3 Integration**: Storage of raw data in a structured, date-prefixed manner
6. **Utility Scripts**: Various scripts for running flows, deploying, and testing

## Component Details

### 1. SEC EDGAR API Client (`utils/sec_edgar_client.py`)

This client provides functions for:
- Retrieving companies by SIC code
- Getting company filings
- Transforming SEC EDGAR data into our structured format
- Enforcing rate limits (10 requests per second as per SEC guidelines)

### 2. Company Universe Flow (`flows/sec_edgar/company_universe_flow.py`)

A Prefect flow that:
- Fetches companies from SEC EDGAR API for each pharmaceutical-related SIC code
- Stores raw data in MinIO S3
- Loads data into staging tables
- Merges valid data into main tables
- Logs pipeline runs for monitoring

### 3. Database Schema (`db/sec_edgar_schema.sql`)

The following tables are created:
- `sec_companies`: Main table for SEC company data
- `sec_filings`: Table for SEC filings data
- `staging_sec_companies`: Staging table for ETL processing
- `staging_sec_filings`: Staging table for filings
- `pipeline_run_logs`: Table for tracking pipeline runs

### 4. Prefect Integration

We've set up Prefect with:
- Flow deployment script (`scripts/deploy_company_universe.py`)
- Agent startup script (`scripts/start_prefect_agent.py`)
- Scheduled runs (daily at 1 AM UTC)
- Proper task configuration with retries and error handling

### 5. Utility Scripts

- `run_full_demo.py`: Demonstrates the entire pipeline from start to finish
- `run_company_universe.ps1`: PowerShell script for running the flow
- `deploy_company_universe.py`: Prefect deployment script

## How to Verify the Implementation

### Step 1: Check Infrastructure

Ensure all components are running:
```powershell
docker-compose ps
```

You should see the following containers running:
- `mytoppharma-postgres-1`
- `mytoppharma-minio-1`
- `mytoppharma-prefect-1`

### Step 2: Check Database Schema

Verify the SEC EDGAR schema has been created:
```powershell
docker exec mytoppharma-postgres-1 psql -U postgres -d toppharma -c "\dt sec*"
```

You should see:
- `sec_companies`
- `sec_filings`
- `staging_sec_companies`
- `staging_sec_filings`

### Step 3: Run the Demo Flow

Run the full demonstration flow:
```powershell
cd app
.\venv\Scripts\activate
python scripts/run_full_demo.py
```

Watch the output to ensure:
- Infrastructure checks pass
- Company data is retrieved from SEC EDGAR
- Data is saved to MinIO S3
- Data is loaded into staging tables
- Data is merged into main tables
- Pipeline run is logged

### Step 4: Verify Data in the Database

Check the SEC companies table:
```powershell
docker exec mytoppharma-postgres-1 psql -U postgres -d toppharma -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sec_companies;"
```

Check the main companies table:
```powershell
docker exec mytoppharma-postgres-1 psql -U postgres -d toppharma -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM companies;"
```

### Step 5: Check MinIO S3 Storage

Open the MinIO console at http://localhost:9001 (login with minioadmin/minioadmin) and:
1. Navigate to the "top-pharma-data-lake" bucket
2. Browse to the "sec_edgar" directory
3. Verify files are stored with date-prefixed paths

### Step 6: Check Prefect UI

Open the Prefect UI at http://localhost:4200 and:
1. Check for registered flows under "Flows" section
2. Verify the "SEC EDGAR Company Universe Flow" is present
3. Check for scheduled runs

## Next Steps

Now that the implementation is complete, here are some potential next steps:

1. **Expand Data Collection**: Add more data points from 10-K filings
2. **Add Additional Data Sources**: Integrate FDA, ClinicalTrials.gov, etc.
3. **Improve Data Quality**: Add more validation and cleansing steps
4. **Enhance Monitoring**: Set up alerts for failed flows

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - Verify PostgreSQL is running: `docker ps | grep postgres`
   - Check connection details in `prefect_config.py`

2. **S3 Connection Issues**:
   - Verify MinIO is running: `docker ps | grep minio`
   - Check S3 configuration in `s3_client.py`

3. **Prefect Issues**:
   - Verify Prefect server is running: `docker ps | grep prefect`
   - Check Prefect API URL in `prefect_config.py`
   - Ensure agent is running: `prefect agent list`

4. **SEC EDGAR API Issues**:
   - Check rate limits in `prefect_config.py`
   - Verify User-Agent is set properly in requests
