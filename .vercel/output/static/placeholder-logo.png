This is a placeholder for a PNG image file.

Since we can't directly create binary files through this interface, you should:

1. Create a simple 200x200 pixel PNG image with:
   - Light gray background (#f3f4f6)
   - Dark gray pill/capsule icon or company building icon (#6b7280)
   - Text "No Logo" in dark gray (#6b7280)

2. Save it as "placeholder-logo.png" in the public directory

This file will be used as a fallback when company logos can't be loaded.
